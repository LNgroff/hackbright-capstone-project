# Final capstone project for Hackbright Academy

<sup>:apple: Hackbright Academy Software Engineering Program</sup>

<sup>Park Finder allows a user to search for nearby national
parks based on ecological or geographical features. i.e. prairies, caves, 
mountains, waterfalls, dunes. If they want, the user can narrow the search results 
by location. The user is then able to create a list of favorite parks that 
they can refer to in the future. </sup>


<!-- Future features may include a compare feature for parks. The base will
search by state, with hopes to include a search feature based on zipcode,
location, and/or a radius. -->
