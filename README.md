# Final capstone project for Hackbright Academy

<sup>:apple: Hackbright Academy Software Engineering Program</sup>

<sup>This will be a web app that allows a user to search for nearby national
parks based on ecological or geographical features. i.e. prairies, caves, 
mountains, waterfalls, dunes. The user will be able to create a list of
favorite parks that they can refer to in the future. </sup>


<!-- Future features may include a compare feature for parks. The base will
search by state, with hopes to include a search feature based on zipcode,
location, and/or a radius. -->
