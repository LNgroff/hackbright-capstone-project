# Final capstone project for Hackbright Academy


### Hackbright Academy Full-Stack Software Engineering Program

Park Finder allows a user to search for national parks based on ecological or geographical features. i.e. prairies, caves, mountains, waterfalls, dunes. If they want, the user can narrow the search results by location. The user is then able to create a list of favorite parks that they can refer to in the future. All details about the national parks are from the National Park Service API.
